# What Happens When You Type https://www.google.com and Press Enter?

## Introduction
When you type https://www.google.com in your browser and press Enter, a complex series of steps occurs in milliseconds. Let's break down this process to understand how the web stack works.

## 1. DNS Request
The Domain Name System (DNS) resolves the human-readable domain name (www.google.com) into an IP address:

1. Browser checks its DNS cache
2. If not found, queries the operating system's DNS resolver
3. DNS resolver contacts root nameservers
4. Root servers direct to .com TLD nameservers
5. TLD nameservers direct to Google's authoritative nameservers
6. Google's nameservers return the IP address

## 2. TCP/IP
Once the IP address is obtained:

1. Browser initiates TCP connection using three-way handshake:
   - SYN (Synchronize)
   - SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge)
   - ACK (Acknowledge)
2. IP protocol handles routing between networks
3. Data is broken into packets for transmission

## 3. Firewall
Before establishing connection:

1. Network firewall checks outbound request
2. Verifies if HTTPS traffic (port 443) is allowed
3. Google's firewall examines incoming request
4. Security rules and policies are enforced

## 4. HTTPS/SSL
Secure connection establishment:

1. SSL/TLS handshake begins
2. Client sends supported cipher suites
3. Server chooses encryption method
4. Certificates are exchanged and validated
5. Symmetric encryption keys generated
6. Secure tunnel established

## 5. Load-Balancer
Traffic management:

1. Request arrives at Google's load balancer
2. Load balancer checks server health
3. Uses algorithms (e.g., round-robin, least connections)
4. Distributes request to optimal server
5. Maintains session persistence if needed

## 6. Web Server
Front-end processing:

1. Web server (e.g., Nginx, Apache) receives request
2. Handles SSL termination
3. Processes HTTP headers
4. Serves static content if applicable
5. Routes dynamic requests to application server

## 7. Application Server
Business logic:

1. Processes the request
2. Executes required business logic
3. Generates dynamic content
4. Manages user sessions
5. Handles authentication/authorization

## 8. Database
Data retrieval:

1. Application server queries database
2. Database executes query optimization
3. Returns requested data
4. Results are processed
5. Response is formatted and sent back

## Response Flow
The generated response travels back:

1. Database → Application Server
2. Application Server → Web Server
3. Web Server → Load Balancer
4. Load Balancer → Internet
5. Through firewalls and network infrastructure
6. Finally reaching your browser

The browser then processes the response and renders the Google homepage, ready for your search query.
